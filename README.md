# AdventureGame
This is ment to be a game consisting of many smal projects. All fore the sake of practicing.

You spawn as teenage kid during the middle ages not far away from the fortress. You can explore the fortress and comunicate with the villigars. My goal is that the player and the programmers together will create a fictional worl that grows with multipple of paths to explore with easter eggs and bad jokes to find. 

The "end result" of this game should be a world where the player can add things quite freely to the world and play a bunch of mini games. My goal is that the player should be able to save and later on continue in the same world. Features added to the game by a player should be accessible by the player after reloding the game. This requires that te code for adding new stuff is well written and does not add anything to the game taht will make the game crash.

The prefered language for code in this project is preferebly Java.
